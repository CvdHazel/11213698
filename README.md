## Homework Week 6

The rock band Bring Me The Horizon released their sixth album *amo* on the 25th of January 2019. The sound of this album is totally different than we are used to. That is why I'm using this album as my corpus and comparing it to their older albums. It represents the changes artists make in their carreer and maybe also a reason why they do it. One song called 'heavy metal' off their new album talks about their change in genre and the reaction on it from their fans. This is why this corpus is a good representation of chooses artist make and the effect it will have on their fanbase. 

In this first week I have already found differences between the albums by using the Spotify features. 'Dancebility' in *amo* (M = 0.522 and SD = 0.121) is much higher than the other five albums. Their first album *Count your Blessings* has a dancibility mean of 0.309 and standard deviation of 0.0855 and the album that scored the lowest mean on dancebility is *There is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen it. There is a Heaven Let's Keep it a Secret* (M = 0.273 and SD = 0.111).
