## Week 6

The rock band Bring Me The Horizon released their sixth album *amo* on the 25th of January 2019. The sound of this album is totally different than fans are used to hearing from them. That is the reason why I'm using this album as my corpus and comparing it to their older albums. It represents the changes artists make in their carreer and maybe also a reason why they do it. One song called 'heavy metal' off Bring Me The Horizon's new album talks about their change in genre and the reaction of their fans:

*"And I keep picking petals/
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore/
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank/
Says it ain't heavy metal"*

This is why this corpus is a good representation of choices artist make and the effect it will have on their fanbase. 

In this first week I have already found differences between the albums by using the Spotify features. 'Dancebility' in *amo* (M = 0.522 and SD = 0.121) is much higher than the other five albums. Their first album *Count your Blessings* has a dancibility mean of 0.309 and standard deviation of 0.0855 and the album that scored the lowest mean on dancebility is *There is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen it. There is a Heaven Let's Keep it a Secret* (M = 0.273 and SD = 0.111). 

While *amo* scores the highest on 'dancebility', it scores the lowest on the 'energy' feature. Here the mean is 0.785 and standard deviation is 0.165. *Count your Blessings* has a mean of 0.900 and standard deviation of 0.198, but *sempiternal* exceeds this with a mean of 0.912 and a standard deviation of 0.0883. The difference in energy between these three albums is certainly noticable for listeners. "Energetic tracks feel fast, loud and noisy" as Spotify states and some might define heavy metal the same. If we use this statement we can conclude that Bring Me The Horizon's first album is more 'heavy metal' than their latest one, which is what a lot of fans say and the band themselves predicted in their new song 'heavy metal.
